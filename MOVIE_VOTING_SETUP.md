# Movie Voting Feature Setup

This guide explains how to set up the movie voting feature that allows users to search for movies, vote on them, and compare votes with their friends.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title using The Movie Database (TMDB) API
- **Genre Browsing**: Browse movies by genre (Romance, Action, Comedy, etc.) with pagination
- **Interactive Movie Selection**: Choose movies together with friends in a guided, fun experience
- **Voting System**: Upvote or downvote movies
- **Friend Comparison**: Compare your votes with friends to find movies you both like
- **Vote Categories**:
  - Both Upvoted: Movies you and your friend both upvoted
  - You Upvoted: Movies only you upvoted
  - Friend Upvoted: Movies only your friend upvoted

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get TMDB API Key

1. Go to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Go to your account settings
4. Navigate to the "API" section
5. Request an API key for "Developer" use
6. Copy your API key

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Add your TMDB API key to your `.env` file:

```env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

### 3. Database Migration

Run the database migration to create the new tables:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

This will create:

- `movie_table`: Stores movie information from TMDB
- `movie_vote_table`: Stores user votes on movies

### 4. Access the Feature

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/movies` in your application
2. Use the search bar to find movies
3. Vote on movies using the upvote/downvote buttons
4. Select a friend from the dropdown to compare votes
